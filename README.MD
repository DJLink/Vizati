# Vizati is now free to celebrate 10th anniversary.

![](promo_images/large_header.jpg?raw=true)

Vizati was originally developed in 2010 by [Rita Silva](https://rita-silva.com/) (Art) and [David Amador](https://www.david-amador.com/) (Code) and released on June 11 2010, it was developed for Xbox 360, Windows, iOS and Windows Phone. Over the years the game was removed from the several stores, so in order to celebrate it's 10th anniversary and for game preservation purposes the game is being released for free in it's original state, nothing was changed. I tested on Windows 10 and still runs. 

This repo does not contain the source code, maybe one day. I know it's weird to host it here but this way I know for sure this won't be gone lost in some hosting, I don't have the time to clean up the code and make sure it still builds, the main purpuse is to make sure the game itself isn't gone forever. So in this repo you can get:

- Original XNA build with installer (Windows)
- Unfinished Native C++/GL version (Windows)
- Game Manual
- Some bad prototype screens
- Several promo screenshots
- Original website, I didn't changed any of the code, just commented Google ad-sense code, the rest is as it was made, for better or worse.

I hope you enjoy it!
